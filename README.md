# News App

## Description

A Flutter-based news app that utilizes the GetX package for state management, API integration, and route handling provides a smooth and responsive user experience. The app fetches real-time news articles from an API, presenting them in a clean, easy-to-navigate interface. With the use of url_launcher, users can open full articles in their web browser directly from the app. The combination of Flutter's flexible UI components and GetX's reactive architecture ensures fast performance and a seamless browsing experience.
